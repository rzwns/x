McAfee
Born To Be Wild (Chapter 1)
3:13
John McAfee was born in 1945 and grew up in an unstable home where his alcoholic
3:18
father would physically abuse him and his mother and when John was just 15 years old his father took his own life
3:24
John was left traumatized and went off to college to study mathematics hoping for a fresh start but this is where his
3:31
own heavy drinking and drug use began as a broke college student John needed a way to make money to fund his expensive
3:37
addictions and so Jon started his first small business selling magazines which helped him develop his skills as a
3:43
Salesman however Jon soon realized he could make a lot more money if he was willing to break the law and so he
3:49
decided to start selling a different product cocaine I used to sell drugs because if you take enough drugs the
3:56
only way you can support your habit is to sell to others so um um and and for many years I did despite the drink and
4:02
drugs John learned the basics of early computer programming which helped him land a job after college as a programmer
4:07
at NASA's Institute for space studies where he worked on the Apollo program he then moved to Silicon Valley where his
4:13
computer skills were in extremely high demand which allowed him to get several prestigious programming jobs at places
4:19
like loed and Xerox however John often found corporate life very dull and so he
4:24
continued using all kinds of drugs and even took LSD in the mornings on his way to work at one job his daily routine
4:31
consisted of drinking a bottle of scotch and doing coke at his desk although he was eventually C and fired there was
4:37
also another job where he took the psychedelic drug DMT into work with him he tried just a small amount at first
4:42
but he didn't feel anything so he decided to take the entire bag as a result he was tripping so badly that he
4:49
no longer knew what the function of his job was and he fled the office and hid behind a trash can needless to say he
4:55
got fired from that job too luckily though all of that soon wouldn't matter as JN had a new business idea of his
Dawn Of The Computer Virus (Chapter 2)
5:12
own in 1986 the first computer virus to affect IBM personal computers was
5:18
discovered it was called brain and after looking into the virus John quickly came up with a code that could stop it from
5:24
infecting the target computer I was reading think what the heck is is this and then it came me oh I
5:32
know what they did I got some code that really replicates itself and as soon as I got that I got you know that's easy
5:39
things I wrote a little program and that was the beginning of my it only took John a day and a half to come up with
5:45
the antivirus software but that one day's work would soon change his life forever at the time very few people had
5:52
even heard of a computer virus you really had to be a computer programmer to even care about it but John McAfee
5:58
saw the potential for this to be a high demand regular consumer product if people learned what computer viruses
6:04
were they would become afraid of those threats and once they were afraid they would surely want to protect themselves
6:10
by buying the Cure so in 1987 John founded a business called McAfee Associates and began selling his product
6:17
called virus scan he would start customers on a free trial of the product and then charge companies to use the
6:22
full version however Jon needed to bring more attention to computer viruses in order to sell more of his product so
6:29
here arranged to be interviewed on news stations to talk about it and this is where John's salesman skills really paid
6:34
off JN used fear tactics to make people believe if they didn't download his antivirus software it could mean losing
6:41
all of the information on their computers I see infections of small companies where every computer has
6:46
become infected and the company is near collapsed from Financial loss this was enough to convince businesses that they
6:52
needed to prepare for these potential threats by 1992 more than half of Fortune 100 companies had maca antivirus
6:59
software on their computers and John was making millions of dollars in licensing and later that Year John would get an
7:06
even bigger opportunity to profit from Fear One of the first big viruses to get a lot of mainstream media attention was
7:12
dubbed Michelangelo this was a virus that was said to be lying dormant in computers and that it would wake up on
7:18
March 6th Michelangelo's birthday and overwrite all your data this was the perfect virus to create a panic because
7:25
until March 6th you would have no idea if you were infected so John went on the news claiming that as many as 5 million
7:32
computers could already be affected by the virus but they just didn't know it yet this is the number one virus it is
7:38
the number one computer threat it's real and it's going to happen on the 6th of March and thus people began to Panic by
7:44
his antivirus software to protect themselves however once March 6th rolled around it turns out that only 10,000 to
7:51
20,000 computers were actually affected sales of MAA software had skyrocketed though and many people accused JN of
7:58
exaggerating the virus as impact in order to sell more copies of his antivirus program but either way by 1993
8:05
he owned 67% of the antivirus Market the company was bringing in millions of dollars in annual revenue and yet John
8:12
only had 20 employees and instead of looking for qualified professionals John would simply hire people he liked he
8:18
would keep them in the office for days at a time with them sleeping at their desks a former employee of the company
8:24
said the work environment was borderline cult-like because the employees were willing to do almost anything John asked
8:30
they had a group called little foxes where they um would give points for uh
8:38
having sex in different spots of the office it's fair to say it wasn't your typical company and yet because they're
8:45
antivirus software was in such high demand they were making a lot of money and when JN took the company public on
8:50
the stock market it brought his net worth up to $80 million but now that the company was
8:56
publicly traded investors began to have a say in and how things were run they wanted to make the company into a much
9:02
larger and more professional Corporation of course John did not want that so less
9:07
than 2 years after the IPO Jon sold his shares of the company for $100 million
9:12
and separated himself completely from the business he had started and this is where things started to get
A New Era (Chapter 3)
9:28
crazy
9:39
now that Jon had left his antivirus company he was a multi-millionaire and had enough money to never work another
9:45
day in his life but having all of this wealth made John paranoid he began to
9:50
carry a gun with him everywhere and he was still taking lots of drugs which only enhanced his constant paranoia all
9:57
of this led Jon towards more spiritual Pursuits in the year 2000 he bought
10:02
nearly 300 acres of land in Colorado and opened a yoga and meditation center and
10:07
then invited yoga students to come stay at this home for free John then went on to write several books about yoga and
10:13
soon dozens of students flocked to his Yoga Center claiming that they were captivated by his personality rumors
10:20
began to spread that John was actually running a cult it was during this time that John became obsessed with a new
10:26
hobby that he called aot trekking which is where you fly an ultra light aircraft low to the ground over a rugged terrain
10:33
which is extremely dangerous but John thrived on doing dangerous things he soon began creating websites and ads to
10:40
get other people interested in aerot trekking and he even started a company that offered aerot treking flights
10:45
across the New Mexico desert however this ended in tragedy you see John
10:51
trained his 22-year-old nephew to be one of the pilots but in 2006 his nephew
10:56
crashed his plane into a remote Canyon in Arizona and was killed there was also a passenger on board named Robert who
11:03
died as well and since John owned the aerot trekking company Robert's family wanted to sue Jon for $5 million in a
11:10
wrongful death lawsuit now at this point paying $5 million would have been very doable for Jon but of course he
11:17
certainly didn't want to pay and in truth this wasn't the first lawsuit someone had filed against him johon
11:22
believed that his wealth made him a Target so instead of facing the courts John decided to flee to the country of
11:29
bise where his lawsuits in the United States would no longer be valid before he left John made a big show of selling
11:36
his assets including his Colorado Yoga Retreat he invited news crews to broadcast the auction of his airplanes
11:42
boats and Estates and he told the reporters that he had lost most of his fortune he was basically trying to
11:47
convince the world he was going broke it was only in later years John admitted that was a lie he was just trying to
11:54
stop people suing him it's nobody's business so the numbers that I throw out
11:59
or numbers that I just randomly feel like thr out if the number four looks good today I'll say we're 4 million you
12:05
know it's meaningless believe nothing I say when it comes to my
Trouble In Paradise (Chapter 4)
12:21
work John moved to Biz and had the opportunity to retire and sell down in a
12:26
tropical Paradise he considered it the perfect society as if you had enough money in B you could buy anything or
12:33
anyone who you wanted and one of the first things John did was byy guns and computers for the local police
12:39
presumably to get them on side John then spent the first few months snorkeling and relaxing on the beach with the many
12:45
different girls he was simultaneously dating however John was always looking for his next business venture and that
12:52
would begin when he met a microbiologist from Harvard named Allison Adano Allison
12:57
was visiting Biz because she had heard about local healers using plant medicine these plants contained a chemical which
13:03
stops bacteria from spreading and Allison was hoping to make a herbal antibiotic out of these plants when
13:09
Allison met John in bise he loved the idea and offered to set up a lab in the middle of the bise jungle for them to
13:15
work on creating these plant-based antibiotics it was such an exciting opportunity that Allison left behind her
13:21
life in America and moved to B however very soon after the project began John
13:26
started inviting press to come to B to see the lab except this was too soon Allison had
13:31
nothing to show them yet so John instructed her to put water with colored dye in beakers to make it appear as
13:37
though they were making progress on some revolutionary new drug even though they hadn't done anything yet but John beli
13:43
the medeor attention would help get more investors meanwhile Jon hired over 100 locals to build a huge house for him and
13:50
at first the ballian locals absolutely loved Jon because he paid $45 per day
13:55
even though the average was just $25 however if it soon became clear that johon was gaining more and more control
14:02
over the local community Jon started hiring bodyguards with criminal records who were armed with guns and wearing
14:08
sunglasses and camouflage uniforms like they were in the military John called them his Hitmen and they were basically
14:14
his own private Army everybody I hired was an ex-felon and had spent half of her life in prison John then began
14:21
setting an 800 p.m curfew for the local Village of carita by 9:00 p.m. his group
14:26
of bodyguards would drive through the town checking for anyone who disobeyed him now John claimed he was doing this
14:32
to clean up the town which was rampant with crime but he never explained what he was doing and many locals were left
14:38
terrified as well as the tourists who would unknowingly be walking on the beaches at night only to see Jon walking
14:44
the streets with a gun and armed guards it felt like Jon had basically taken over the small village of carmalita Jon
14:51
also had several vicious guard dogs that would roam freely on the beach and there were multiple incidents of the dogs
14:57
biting and attacking people the neighbors would try to report these attacks to the police but no official
15:02
action was ever taken many locals suspected this was due to the police being paid off by Jon as Jon had built
15:08
them a police station and supplied them with weapons Allison eventually decided that this was all too much for her he
15:14
talked about taking over the ballian government he would talk about his Hitmen he would talk about how he could
15:20
have people hurt or killed and um you know honestly I was I was scared so
15:28
Alison confronted Jon about wanting to go home and abandon their jungle VAP project according to Allison during this
15:34
conversation she said she had a headache so John gave her two pills and a cup of orange juice soon after Allison passed
15:42
out this is the next thing she remembers he was standing over me naked and I woke
15:49
up the next morning and I was sick I was dry heaving
15:55
and I was dizzy and I grab my clothes I don't even remember
16:01
taking them off Allison claims John drugged and assaulted her and when she returned to the United States she
16:07
immediately contacted the authorities however the US authorities had no jurisdiction in belies so the case never
16:13
went any further and John denies her story entirely Alison Adano a mad woman
16:19
well she can claim whatever she likes never had sex with her certainly never raped her she seemed rational she was
16:25
not as for the lab they'd been running in the jungle that would have ually get raided by bellian authorities over
16:31
suspicion JN had been making meth there they did find several chemicals they couldn't even identify but nothing
16:37
illegal and no charges were filed however things would soon get darker
16:42
when John McAfee would find himself accused of
Murder In Belize (Chapter 5)
16:57
murder John was paranoid of anyone trying to rob or kill him which is why he paid for
17:03
so much protection I have an officer living on my compound it makes me feel safe makes me feel safer to know that
17:10
all the criminals that might want to rob me know there's a policeman living there yet somehow despite all of this security
17:16
someone managed to break into Jon's house and steal from him words spread around the local community and John
17:21
heard that the robbery was committed by a man named David Middleton instead of reporting it to the police it's alleged
17:27
that John py group of SP thousands of dollars to kidnap David from his home and make an example of him one morning
17:34
CH McAfee called me and he said I need to chastise this guy to teach him a
17:40
little respect so Jan asked me if I could bring three guys up here three bad
17:47
mean ass looking guy to slap him up a little and tell him be careful it's
17:54
claimed they beat and tased David then dropped him off in the middle of the street in front of multiple Witnesses
18:00
David went to the hospital but the beating had been so brutal that he slipped into a coma and died a few days
18:05
later even though it was widely believed Jon was behind the attack the police did nothing however pretty soon after one of
18:12
Jon's neighbors an American named Greg fall wanted to try and stand up to JN Greg had come to biz for a peaceful
18:18
retirement and he hated how Jon allowed his dogs to run freely on the beach and attack people greed confronted Jon
18:25
several times about how aggressive his dogs were and how they bitten people just trying to walk along the beach
18:30
eventually Greg had had enough and he threatened to poison the dogs if John didn't do anything to control them
18:35
shortly after this Jon's dogs were poisoned since this happened so soon after the confrontation with Greg Jon
18:42
felt that only one person could be responsible when someone says they're going to poison your dogs and the
18:49
following day your dogs get poisoned I don't think there's too many people that wouldn't have a thought in
18:56
their mind about killing that person the very next day Greg fall was found
19:01
dead with a gunshot wound to the head and thus John became the prime suspect in Greg Fall's murder and went on the
19:07
Run John MFE news from B John McAfee who's been on John mcaf is a person of
19:13
interest American Tech Mogul at the center of an international murder mystery mcafe is being hunted for
19:19
questioning in the murder of his neighbor but of course JN had a very different story let me make this
19:25
perfectly clear I had nothing to do with the murder of Gregory Fall John claimed
19:30
that in fact he had hacked the bise government and had proof of intense corruption as a result the bise
19:36
government had been trying to kill him but shot his neighbor by mistake and that's why John fled he's dead yeah they
19:42
killed him um so it It sped me out when I heard oh my God they were coming from
19:48
me they came for me they got the wrong house now where this gets even Messier is that in 2016 Showtime released a
19:54
documentary about this called Gringo the dangerous life of John McAfee and in that several former employees of
20:00
Jon's gave interviews where they openly talk about Jon paying for Hitmen and make it seem pretty clearcut that John
20:06
was responsible for the murder of Greg fall but after this some of those exact same employees appeared on John McAfee's
20:13
YouTube channel saying that Showtime had paid them to say those statements and that they were untrue so now those same
20:19
people were claiming John was innocent he would never ever hire or kill someone
20:27
of course John could be paying them and either way they're clearly unreliable sources if they're willing to claim two
20:33
entirely different stories so it's all a little blurry and even Jon's girlfriend
20:38
at the time wasn't sure when anyone asked me do you think John killed his neighbor my response is I don't know so
20:46
whilst it's all extremely suspicious there were never any charges so we can't say definitively what happened the night
20:52
of Greg Fall's murder what we do know is that as soon as John heard that the police wanted to question him as a
20:58
suspecting Greg's death he immediately went on the run it was time for him to leave Biz and never look back John mcafe
21:06
is a wanted man the one Silicon Valley Golden Boy is now in hiding somewhere in Central
Running From The Law (Chapter 6)
21:22
America John was very deliberate in his efforts to avoid the police he started wearing disguises dyed his hair and
21:29
dressed like an old man he'd walk around with a walking stick and even pretend he'd had a
21:36
stroke but instead of going on the run in secret John immediately invited two reporters from Vice news to be with him
21:43
while he was on the Run he felt this would help him get his side of the story across and maybe provide some extra
21:48
protection he also just thought it would be entertaining content and sure enough this footage would later become the
21:53
Netflix documentary called Running With the Devil the wild world of John mcaf John explained to the reporters his view
22:00
that this was all one big setup by the bellian government to put him in jail and assassinate him and so after hiding
22:06
in a sand bunker for hours John managed to escape to the neighboring country of Guatemala by illegally crossing the
22:12
border by boats once he was out of bise John thought he was going to be safe but then something quite ridiculous happened
22:20
the reporters from Vice he'd invited to join him on the Run uploaded their interview with John to the internet
22:25
however this included a photo they takeen which contain their exact GPS location in the metadata metadata gives
22:32
the file authenticity but a part of that metad dat is also
22:40
geolocations the Geo data was on the image and the gave GPS coordinates so
22:46
John was supposed to be hiding in Guatemala and yet now the entire world knew the exact coordinates of where he
22:52
was it didn't take long for the authorities to find him in fact all kinds of people showed up guys
22:58
submachine guns the literal equivalent of the FBI here's interpole here's a guy
23:03
with a DEA jacket on Dr surrounded and so he did what anyone would do in that
23:08
situation he uh started playing the
23:14
flute from here since the vice reporters were there with John they captured video
23:19
footage of his arrest John where are you going to
23:25
jail since John was in Guatemala legally interpo wanted to send Jon back to bise
23:30
for questioning about Greg's death however Jon's lawyer informed him that he could file an appeal at 3:00 p.m.
23:37
that was hours away so Jon somehow needed to buy a little more time so JN faked a heart
23:45
attack you faked the heart attack sure I faked it what would you have done John was rushed to hospital and then at once
23:50
300 p.m. rolled around JN suddenly said he was feeling much better but because the appeal was now filed they couldn't
23:56
just send him back to believe so Guatemalan authorities deported him back to the United States instead which
24:03
is exactly what John wanted just like that John McAfee was a free man he was
24:08
still wanted in B for questioning but since he hadn't been officially charged with any crime he was able to live his
24:14
life normally back in the US which led some to question had John McAfee just
24:20
gotten away with murder hey guys I know some of you have

Back To The USA (Chapter 7)
24:56
below once John McAfee was sent back to the USA in December of 2012 it didn't take
25:02
long for him to settle into his new life on literally his first day back in Miami he met a prostitute 38 years younger
25:09
than him who would soon become his third wife he then started his own YouTube channel and his very first upload was
25:15
called how to uninstall mcafe antivirus in the video he shows himself surrounded by women snorting bath salts and just
25:22
generally acting like a madman This was meant to be a parody of what the media was making him out to be
25:28
but many would argue it was pretty accurate 15 years ago I had some beautiful software and they took it over
25:34
I don't know what they did it was like the time I hired that Bangkok prostitute to do my taxes while I [ __ ] my
25:40
accountant it was terrible it was clear johnelle had a talent for manipulating the media and getting attention he soon
25:46
started getting lots of news coverage as a security expert where he warned of the Cyber threats the US was facing in fact
25:53
when you Googled him you no longer saw that he was suspected of murder he had successfully rebranded himself and he
25:58
even grew a decent following on Twitter his fans loved his bold opinions and wild takes he became so popular in fact
26:06
that in 2016 John McAfee decided to run for president of the United States is it
26:11
official are you running for president have you filed the papers to run for president I filed the papers on Tuesday
26:17
uh I'm officially running yes ma'am then in 2017 John started promoting cryptocurrencies as a way to avoid
26:24
paying tax he would promote an altcoin on his Twitter and then once people invested and the price went up he'd cash
26:29
out it was a pump and dump scheme and according to the Department of Justice John personally made over $2 million
26:35
from this shortly after Greg Fall's family sued John McAfee for his wrongful
26:41
death technically John was still wanted for questioning impes about Greg's death but because John had fled the country
26:46
the criminal charges against him weren't pursued so now Greg F's family was seeking civil action using the American
26:53
court system however John never responded or showed up to court this this meant that the judge decided he
26:59
should pay $25 million in Damages by default John publicly responded on his Twitter to say that he had been sued
27:05
dozens of times and know well over $200 million in total but he claimed he didn't have any money to give them in
27:12
reality John was still a multi-millionaire but he was hiding his money in Shell companies and eventually
27:18
this would all catch up with John when he picked a battle he couldn't win the IRS you see John had publicly stated
27:25
that he hadn't paid any taxes in 8 years firstly he claims he simply hadn't made any income and then he also said it was
27:32
for ideological reasons as he'd already paid T of millions in taxes already and felt he received nothing in return I
27:39
have not paid taxes for a years I've made no secret of it I have not filed returns every year I tell the IRS I'm
27:45
not filing return I have no intention of doing so come and find me of course this
27:50
couldn't Last Forever Without facing the
27:56
consequences before we get to the next chapter I want to help you save time and money with

Conspiracy (Chapter 8)
29:14
magnates in 2020 JN fled from the United States again this time because the IRS
29:20
was pursuing him for not paying his taxes he got on board a yacht that he bought from The Wolf of Wall Street
29:25
filled it with guns alcohol and drugs and set sail he was once again on the run but this time from American
29:32
authorities however that didn't stop him from running a campaign for the 2020 US Presidency they want to silence me I
29:39
will not allow that I am running my campaign in Exile on this boat for the
29:48
duration for almost 2 years John sailed around the world once again he wore various disguises although he would
29:54
randomly just tell people who he was and even take selfies with them you're Ma I use you for my um yes for your antivirus
30:02
yes ma' but on October 6th 2020 John was found and arrested by authorities in
30:08
Spain in video footage of him in jail Jon tried to explain his way out of the situation but claiming he had Insider
30:14
knowledge about corruption in the IRS however in June 2021 the Spanish National Court approved his extradition
30:21
back to America to face his tax evasion charges John was 75 at this point and
30:26
knew he would spend the rest of his life in jail and so just hours later John hanged himself in his prison cell
30:33
computer software entrepreneur John maafi has been found dead in a prison in Barcelona just hours earlier a Spanish
30:40
Court agreed to extradite him to the United States to face tax evasion charges however even though it was
30:47
confirmed as a suicide in the autopsy John's wife Janice claims that he would never have taken his own life and
30:53
instead blamed us authorities for his death John McAfee was not
30:59
suicidal I spoke with him a few hours before he was found dead this Spar
31:04
theories that John had been murdered especially because 2 years before his death John posted on Twitter if I
31:11
suicide myself I didn't I was whacked he even got a tattoo that said whacked and
31:16
started a cryptocurrency with the same name on top of that after his death there was a post on his Instagram
31:22
account was simply the letter Q soon after the account was deleted spar even
31:27
more conspiracy theories and in yet another twist in the Netflix documentary released after his death one of Jon's
31:34
ex-girlfriends claimed he paid people to fake his death and is actually still alive although there is no evidence of
31:41
this at all the documentary also had another big claim though as there's a recording of John saying that when he
31:46
was younger he got sick of his father's abuse and did something about it suggesting Jon killed his own father and
31:54
just made it look like a suicide and this is the problem problem there are so many wild claims and theories about John
32:01
that establishing what's true is difficult if all the allegations against John are true he is responsible for the
32:07
death of at least three different people and was an incredibly dangerous and violent man but on the other hand none
32:13
of these were proven and many believe John was set up and is actually a hero for trying to expose
32:19
corruption by the end of May I had every computer wired in the government and I'm listening I'm in your office I'm hearing
32:26
everything you're saying they didn't anticipate they forgot who I was I can get inside your computer and screw with
32:32
you and so that's what I did but did Jon actually have all these documents of
32:37
corruption that he claimed John had promised that if he died there was a dead man switch where all the terabytes
32:43
of damning information he had on government corruption would be released but so far at least nothing has come out
32:50
now on this channel I never tried to take sides and instead just present the information and with this story I highly
32:57
recommend looking into it more yourself to draw your own conclusions all I will say is that I think it's clear Jon was
33:03
extremely smart but he was also definitely paranoid and regularly using drugs it's also clear he was good at
33:09
manipulating the media which only makes it even harder to figure out the truth what's undeniable is that there are very
33:16
few people with a life as insane as John McAfee and so we really can't be surprised that even after his death he's
33:22
left behind a legacy of chaos as for McAfee's company it was purchased by Intel in 2011 for 7.6 billion and is now
33:31
valued at around 14 billion it continues to be one of the most popular antivirus softwares and is still used by millions
33:37
of people to this very day now if you enjoyed this story there is one specific
33:42
video I recommend you watch next which is the insane true story of the world's biggest online Black Market Silk Road
33:49
aka the most illegal business in the world just like McAfee this story is so bizarre it feels like a Hollywood movie
33:57
so just click here to check it out now and I'll see you there

cheers
